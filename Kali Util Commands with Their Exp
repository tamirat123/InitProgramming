1.Hostname command:-If you want to know the name of your host/network simply type hostname.
                   Adding a -i to the end will display the IP address of your network.
2.Man command:- Confused about the function of certain Linux commands? Don’t worry, you can easily learn how to use 
              them right from Linux’s shell by using the man command. For instance, entering man tail will show the 
              manual instruction of the tail command. 
3.Top command:- As a terminal equivalent to Task Manager in Windows, the top command will display a list of running processes 
              and how much CPU each process uses.It’s very useful to monitor system resource usage, especially knowing which 
              process needs to be terminated because it consumes too many resources.
4.uname command:- The uname command, short for Unix Name, will print detailed information about your Linux system like the 
                machine name, operating system, kernel, and so on.
5.chown command:- In Linux, all files are owned by a specific user. The chown command enables you to change or transfer the ownership 
                of a file to the specified username. For instance, chown linuxuser2 file.ext will make linuxuser2 as the owner of the file.ext.

# What we saw in the second class is about WEB ATTACK and TCP/IP
## Hello there my name is Tamirat Legesse (Second class Thursday August 18, 2022 AA)
# WEB ATTACK
## A web attack targets vulnerabilities in websites to gain unauthorized access, obtain confidential information, introduce malicious content, or alter the websiteâ€™s content. A web application is a function which allows a user to interact with software via the web browser, such as filling out fields on a voter registration website. A web server is the backend hardware and software that stores the information associated with a website and provides website data to users. Three common web attacks are Structured Query Language injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), and file upload attacks.
# TCP/IP  
## TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires little central management and is designed to make networks reliable with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.
# Similarities between OSI and TCP / IP
## * Both the reference models are based upon layered architecture.
## * The layers in the models are compared with each other. The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to the link layer of the TCP/IP model. The network layers and the transport layers are the same in both the models. The session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer of the OSI model together form the application layer of the TCP/IP model.
# Differences between OSI and TCP / IP
## * OSI model is a generic model that is based upon functionalities of each layer. TCP/IP model is a protocol-oriented standard.
## * OSI model gives guidelines on how communication needs to be done, while TCP/IP protocols layout standards on which the Internet was developed. So, TCP/IP is a more practical model.
## * The OSI has seven layers while the TCP/IP has four layers.

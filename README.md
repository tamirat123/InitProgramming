# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
## Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a Programming language for documents and files useful to display in a web browser. For the writing of this language, we need to create labels that are specific through square brackets or angle brackets: < and >. This language was developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1945 to develop a storage system where things were not lost. Which could connect through hyperlinks. While HTML is a markup language used to format/structure a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a design language that you use to make your web page look nice and presentable CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
